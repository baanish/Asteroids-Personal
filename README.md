# Asteroids Personal
 
This project is a evolved version of my CSC461 Program 5. Adter several feature addions I have decided to scrap most future changes as it was a project meant for 2d gameplay and converting to 3d would be such a huge change that it would be better to start from scratch.

It is playable at https://baanish.github.io/Asteroids-Personal/

### Controls
WASD to move and space to shoot
